We arrived at this implementation by doing a tournament around between multiple implementations.
This one was the winner, however the judges were instructed to list good approaches from the
losing bracket just in case we can make use of them. You can find them at the file included as an argument ($ARGUMENT). Go through and implement what you agree with and what is relevant to us. For the ones you don't find useful / disagree with / or are confused by, explain why.
