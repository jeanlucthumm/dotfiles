We're conceiving a new project.

Context:
- Available templates: python, go, flutter (in ~/nix/templates/)
- Projects live in ~/Code/<project-name>/

Help me brainstorm and flesh out the idea. Use web search to:
- Understand the problem space and who it's for
- Research existing solutions and similar products
- Find relevant libraries, APIs, or services

When ready, create:
1. Project dir with README.md capturing the concept
2. Suggest the appropriate `nix flake init -t ~/nix#<template>` command
