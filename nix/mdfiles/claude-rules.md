## Modular rules with `.claude/rules/`

For larger projects, you can organize instructions into multiple files using the `.claude/rules/` directory. This allows teams to maintain focused, well-organized rule files instead of one large CLAUDE.md.

### Basic structure

Place markdown files in your project's `.claude/rules/` directory:

your-project/
├── .claude/
│ ├── CLAUDE.md # Main project instructions
│ └── rules/
│ ├── code-style.md # Code style guidelines
│ ├── testing.md # Testing conventions
│ └── security.md # Security requirements

All `.md` files in `.claude/rules/` are automatically loaded as project memory, with the same priority as `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

### Path-specific rules

Rules can be scoped to specific files using YAML frontmatter with the `paths` field. These conditional rules only apply when Claude is working with files matching the specified patterns.

```markdown
---
paths: src/api/**/*.ts
---

# API Development Rules

- All API endpoints must include input validation
- Use the standard error response format
- Include OpenAPI documentation comments

Rules without a paths field are loaded unconditionally and apply to all files.

Glob patterns

The paths field supports standard glob patterns:

Pattern	Matches
**/*.ts	All TypeScript files in any directory
src/**/*	All files under src/ directory
*.md	Markdown files in the project root
src/components/*.tsx	React components in a specific directory

You can use braces to match multiple patterns efficiently:

---
paths: src/**/*.{ts,tsx}
---

# TypeScript/React Rules

This expands to match both src/**/*.ts and src/**/*.tsx. You can also combine multiple patterns with commas:

---
paths: {src,lib}/**/*.ts, tests/**/*.test.ts
---

Subdirectories

Rules can be organized into subdirectories for better structure:

.claude/rules/
├── frontend/
│   ├── react.md
│   └── styles.md
├── backend/
│   ├── api.md
│   └── database.md
└── general.md

All .md files are discovered recursively.

Symlinks

The .claude/rules/ directory supports symlinks, allowing you to share common rules across multiple projects:

# Symlink a shared rules directory
ln -s ~/shared-claude-rules .claude/rules/shared

# Symlink individual rule files
ln -s ~/company-standards/security.md .claude/rules/security.md

Symlinks are resolved and their contents are loaded normally. Circular symlinks are detected and handled gracefully.

User-level rules

You can create personal rules that apply to all your projects in ~/.claude/rules/:

~/.claude/rules/
├── preferences.md    # Your personal coding preferences
└── workflows.md      # Your preferred workflows

User-level rules are loaded before project rules, giving project rules higher priority.

Best practices for .claude/rules/:
	•	Keep rules focused: Each file should cover one topic (e.g., testing.md, api-design.md)
	•	Use descriptive filenames: The filename should indicate what the rules cover
	•	Use conditional rules sparingly: Only add paths frontmatter when rules truly apply to specific file types
	•	Organize with subdirectories: Group related rules (e.g., frontend/, backend/)
```
