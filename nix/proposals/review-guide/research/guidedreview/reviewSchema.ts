 * JSON schema for the structured `ReviewPlan` output. Shared by every
 * provider so behavior is consistent regardless of which model produced it.
 *
 * Every field is listed in `required` (including ones that are conceptually
 * optional, like `hunkId`) with a nullable type where needed — this matches
 * both Anthropic's `output_config.format` and OpenAI-style "strict" JSON
 * schema mode, which both want every property declared as required.
